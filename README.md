# iFood-Customer-Analysis-and-Marketing-Strategy

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing customer data and developing a marketing strategy based on the findings. We use techniques such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and interpretation of results to derive actionable insights for marketing campaigns.

## Features

* Preprocessing of customer data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
* Exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior, preferences, and spending patterns.
* Building a machine learning model (i.e. Random Forest) to predict customer behavior and identify important features.
* Interpretation of model results using techniques like permutation importance and correlation analysis.
* Formulating marketing strategies based on the insights gained from the analysis.
